2D Platformer written in C#/XNA featuring a protagonist floating brain against the dinosaurs.

The game is very incomplete in terms of levels, but functionality wise it is getting close to finished.

TODO:

- Still need to create levels, and perhaps more level sets using different weather environments.

- There are some inefficiencies due to things I was unaware of at the time that the game was written.
  For example, every time the player shoots an egg the egg art resource is loaded for that instance, 
  opposed to a static resource used for all eggs loaded only once.
